            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it into a form that cannot be easily understood by unauthorized users. 
                In this project, we explore two fundamental techniques in the field of cryptography:
                the <strong>Caesar Cipher</strong> and the <strong>RSA algorithm</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest encryption methods, based on letter shifting. 
                The RSA algorithm, on the other hand, is a powerful modern technique that uses mathematical concepts such as prime numbers and modular arithmetic.
            </p>
            <p>
                This web application provides detailed explanations of both techniques, followed by interactive tools 
                where users can test encryption and decryption processes in real time.
